# Research Skill

When the user wants to understand something in the codebase:

1. **Locate**: Find the relevant files using the filesystem. Start broad (directory listing), then narrow down.
2. **Read**: Read the key files thoroughly. Don't skim — understand the structure.
3. **Map**: Identify the main components, their relationships, and data flow.
4. **Explain**: Present your findings clearly:
   - Start with a high-level summary.
   - Then detail the key components.
   - Use code references (file:line) to anchor explanations.
5. **Answer**: Address the user's specific question directly.

**Principles:**
- Show your work — reference specific files and lines.
- Distinguish between what the code does and what it should do.
- Note anything surprising or potentially problematic.
