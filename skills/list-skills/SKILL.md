# List Skills

The user is asking about your available skills. For each skill listed in the "Available Skills" section of your system prompt, explain:

1. **What it does** — a plain-language summary.
2. **When it activates** — the trigger words that cause it to inject into your prompt.
3. **How to use it** — what the user should say or do to invoke it.

Be thorough but concise. Present the skills as a numbered list.
